# Part 1: Factor management
With the data set of your choice, after ensuring the variable(s) you’re exploring are indeed factors, you are expected to:

Drop factor / levels;
Reorder levels based on knowledge from data.

Elaboration for the gapminder data set
Drop Oceania. Filter the Gapminder data to remove observations associated with the continent of Oceania. Additionally, remove unused factor levels. Provide concrete information on the data before and after removing these rows and Oceania; address the number of rows and the levels of the affected factors.

Reorder the levels of country or continent. Use the forcats package to change the order of the factor levels, based on a principled summary of one of the quantitative variables. Consider experimenting with a summary statistic beyond the most basic choice of the median.

```{r}
levels(gapminder$continent) #to check the levels of factor continent
nlevels(gapminder$continent) #to check the no.of levels of factor continent
str(gapminder)

g<-gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent !="Oceania") #dropping the level Oceania

g %>%  
mutate(continent=fct_drop(continent)) %>% #dropping unused levels
  str()

g %>%
  droplevels() %>% 
  str()
```
## Output:

The gapminder dataset before dropping Oceania and the unused factor levels had 5 levels for the continent factor namely Africa,Americas,Asia,Europe,Oceania and 142 levels for the factor country.
The number of rows in the dataframe before the dropping of factors was 1704.

After dropping the Oceania the number of factor levels for continent reduces to 4.

After dropping the unused factor levels the number of levels for the factor country reduces to 140 because the countries Australia and New Zealand corresponding to the continent Oceania are the levels being dropped. 

The other columns like year,lifeExp,pop,gdpPercap all remain unchanged as they are not factors.

The number of rows in the dataframe after the dropping of factors is 1680.

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(continent=fct_reorder(continent,pop,.fun=mean)) %>%  #reordering using mean instead of median
  ggplot(aes(continent,lifeExp))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Output: 

`fct_reorder(continent, pop,.fun=mean)`, does some internal wrangling and the summary statistic mean is computed on `pop` for each category in the factor `continent`, and this is reflected in the boxplot for lifeExp of the various continents.

# Part 2: File I/O

Experiment with one or more of write_csv()/read_csv() (and/or TSV friends),  saveRDS()/readRDS(), dput()/dget(). Create something new, probably by filtering or grouped-summarization of Singer or Gapminder. I highly recommend you fiddle with the factor levels, i.e. make them non-alphabetical (see previous section). Explore whether this survives the round trip of writing to file then reading back in.

```{r}
levels(gapminder$continent)

f<-fct_relevel(gapminder$continent,"Oceania","Asia",after=1)%>% #releveling 
  levels() %>% 
  head()
f

h<-fct_collapse(gapminder$continent,"combo" = c("Europe", "Asia")) %>% 
  levels() %>% 
  head()
h

x<-fct_lump(gapminder$continent,n=2) %>% 
  levels() %>% 
  head()
x

write.csv(f,"f.csv")
read.csv("f.csv")

write.csv(h,"h.csv")
read.csv("h.csv")

write.csv(x,"x.csv")
read.csv("x.csv")

```
## Output:
The releveling survives the writing and reading into a csv file.

When writing and reading into a csv file, two columns are created "" "x", where the levels appear as rows under the coulmn head "x" and thier respective position under "".



# Part 3: Visualization design

Remake at least one figure or create a new one, in light of something you learned in the recent class meetings about visualization design and color. Maybe juxtapose your first attempt and what you obtained after some time spent working on it. Reflect on the differences. 

Then, make a new graph by converting this visual (or another, if you’d like) to a plotly graph. What are some things that plotly makes possible, that are not possible with a regular ggplot2 graph?



```{r,width=7,height=7}
p_scales <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(pop, lifeExp)) +
     geom_point(aes(colour=pop), alpha=0.3,shape="square")

p_scales

library(scales)
p_scales +
    scale_x_log10(labels=dollar_format()) +
    scale_colour_distiller(
        trans  = "log10", 
        breaks = 10^(1:10),
        labels=comma_format(),
        palette = "BrBG"
        ) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=(1:10)*10)+
  labs(x="Population",
       y="Life Expectancy",
       title="     LifeExp VS POP")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.text =element_text(size=7),
        panel.background = element_rect(color="blue")) #scalling and adding theme to plot
``` 
## Output:

Plotted the scatter plot of population versus lifeExp to see if there is a realtion between the two.

There is a stark difference between the intial plot and the plot obtained after scalling and theming.

Scalling over log,adding breaks,changing label format and using pallette makes the graph much more readable than before.

-Adding a log scale spreads the data out than before.
-Breaks and labels in scales function make the y-axis and legend much more understandable than before.  
-Different coulours of  palette = "BrBG" makes the datapoints more distinguishable than before.

```{r,width=7,height=7}
p<- ggplot(gapminder, aes(pop, lifeExp)) +
     geom_point(aes(colour=pop), alpha=0.3,shape="square")+
 scale_x_log10(labels=dollar_format()) +
    scale_colour_distiller(
        trans  = "log10", 
        breaks = 10^(1:10),
        labels=comma_format(),
        palette = "BrBG"
        ) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=(1:10)*10)+
  labs(x="Population",
       y="Life Expectancy",
       title="LifeExp VS POP")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.text =element_text(size=7),
        panel.background = element_rect(color="blue"))


 p %>% 
   ggplotly() #creating a plotly image
 
 plot_ly(gapminder, 
        x = ~pop, 
        y = ~lifeExp, 
        z= ~country,
        type = "scatter3d",
        mode = "markers",
        opacity = 0.6) %>% 
    layout(xaxis = list(type = "log"))
```
## Output:

Plotly gives the graph a better finishing, with the squares looking more pronounced and the title in the middle and the legend fancier thus making it publication worthy.

Plotly also has more advanced features allowing us to create a 3D plot for our dataset.


# Part 4: Writing figures to file

Use ggsave() to explicitly save a plot to file. Then use ![Alt text](/path/to/img.png) to load and embed it in your report. You can play around with various options, such as:
Arguments of ggsave(), such as width, height, resolution or text scaling.
Various graphics devices, e.g. a vector vs. raster format.
Explicit provision of the plot object p via ggsave(..., plot = p). Show a situation in which this actually matters.

```{r}
s<-ggplot(iris,aes(Sepal.Length,Sepal.Width))+
  geom_point(aes(color=Species),shape="triangle")+
  ggtitle("Sepal.Width VS Sepal.Length") #creating the image to save in ggsave
s

ggsave("/Users/amitra/Desktop/hw05-malvikamitra1/data/my_plot.png",width=13,height=10,units="cm",scale=1,dpi=400)

```
